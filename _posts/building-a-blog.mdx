It's a warm saterday morning in July. I look at the pile of projects that I once started but never finished. Maybe they were too ambitious, maybe they weren't fun enough, maybe something just came up. The only thing I know is that they all taught me something.

That's when I decided to start a new project, a blog. This would be a great project to get familier with NextJS which I have been fiddling around with for a few days prior.

The blog will need to tick a few boxes for me:

-   Typescript
-   NextJS
-   Posts written in Markdown
-   Not be too difficult

The last point is really so I don't make the project bigger then it needs to be.
The objective is to get a working version up and running on [blog.massaal.com](https://blog.massaal.com/) in a day.
If I can achieve that, I'll be happy.
